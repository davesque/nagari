## What does nagari mean?

In Sanskrit, the ancient language of South Asian literati, the word "naagara"
means "superior".  "Nagari" is the feminine version of that word.  It is also
one of the common names for the Hindi alphabet.  This library is named in honor
of that alphabet which is a marvel of linguistic transcription.  You can read
