1
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:51,695
<i>(man) I just jumped at
the opportunity to go,</i>

2
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:54,130
<i>without even thinking about it, really,</i>

3
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,604
<i>because it opened the way to an old
and very naive childhood fantasy of mine.</i>

4
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:01,697
<i>To go off into the wilderness</i>

5
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:06,336
<i>and test myself against
all the dangerous things lurking there.</i>

6
00:02:06,412 --> 00:02:11,941
<i>And to find that basic animal I secretly
hoped was hidden somewhere in myself.</i>

7
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:16,044
<i>I imagined that at that point
I'd become a new man,</i>

8
00:02:16,122 --> 00:02:20,650
<i>with a strength and courage
that I'd never known before.</i>

9
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:25,894
<i>As I traveled north,
it was on about the third day</i>

10
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:30,595
<i>that the reality of what I was about to try
to do began to seep into my bones</i>

11
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:34,332
<i>and gather in a knot
in the pit of my stomach.</i>

12
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,179
<i>Then I finally reached
the end of the line, Nootsack.</i>

13
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:48,950
<i>The sheer bulk of the supplies
the department sent along set me back,</i>

14
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:51,216
<i>as I had to get not only myself
but all this stuff</i>

15
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,157
<i>another 300 miles into the wilderness.</i>

16
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,297
So, you think north of here?

17
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,100
<i>The place is crawling with 'em,</i>

18
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,867
<i>But you wouldn't wanna go up there, son,</i>

19
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,870
<i>Got nothing to eat up there now,</i>

20
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:18,883
<i>There's nothing but ice
and snow and trees and,,,</i>

21
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:24,047
<i>You would be
the only fresh meat around there,</i>

22
00:03:26,058 --> 00:03:28,549
<i>They'll come after you, son,</i>

23
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:33,061
<i>Just for the ugly fun of tearing you apart,</i>

24
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,831
<i>I'd heard some of the tales
about the Arctic,</i>

25
00:03:42,908 --> 00:03:48,005
<i>The mad trappers, Diamond Tooth Gertie,
the ice-worm cocktail and all that,</i>

26
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,174
<i>so I was prepared
for things to be a little weird.</i>

27
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,718
<i>You found the bayonets,
I knew you would,</i>

28
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:55,777
<i>- Charlie,
- (# bassoon playing)</i>

29
00:03:56,622 --> 00:04:01,184
<i>That's much better, much better, Francis,
Keep practicing,</i>

30
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:05,527
<i>The only plane in Nootsack
belonged to a part-time bush pilot,</i>

31
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,625
<i>gambler and real-estate tycoon
named Rosie Little.</i>

32
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:13,468
<i>While negotiating our deal, he introduced
me to this drink that he'd invented.</i>

33
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:15,769
<i>Known locally as Moose Juice,</i>

34
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:20,210
<i>it consisted of equal parts
Moose Brand beer and ethyl alcohol.</i>

35
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,510
<i>Before I knew it,
my old fear of flying evaporated,</i>

36
00:04:23,582 --> 00:04:28,952
<i>and I spent all the money I had left
on 24 cases of beer.</i>

37
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:40,630
<i>T oo much weight, Tyler,</i>

38
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,499
Hang on!

39
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,096
<i>Whoa,,, Nelly!</i>

40
00:04:54,113 --> 00:04:59,608
<i>Come on, Something else out of there now,
The big, heavy ones, Tyler,</i>

41
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:05,890
<i>I really had no way of knowing
exactly what of the department's gear</i>

42
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,949
<i>we donated to the people of Nootsack.</i>

43
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:11,485
<i>That big wooden box there,
Get rid of it, Go on, You don't need that,</i>

44
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:15,863
<i>But by our third attempt at takeoff,
it was a lot of what I might really need.</i>

45
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:21,429
<i>I tried not to think about it.
In fact, I tried not to think at all.</i>

46
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:35,142
<i>This one is it, I can feel it,</i>

47
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:12,147
<i>With my eyes still shut,
I realized that I was still alive.</i>

48
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:14,954
<i>But this was only the beginning.</i>

49
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:45,279
<i>It's funny how I keep thinking back
to that going-away party.</i>

50
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,309
<i>All the toasts by Dr Spivey
and Dr Showwalter,</i>

51
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:53,449
<i>and everybody singing
old Johnny Horton songs.</i>

52
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:59,794
<i>And the cake with all the coconut frosting,
with the plastic snowshoes on top.</i>

53
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,972
<i>But, then, why me?</i>

54
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:15,136
<i>Maybe this whole thing was a mistake.</i>

55
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:24,215
<i>Maybe my name just somehow
got onto the wrong page.</i>

56
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:28,282
<i>It might have been a typo, or maybe
somebody spilled a cup of coffee,</i>

57
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,818
<i>shuffled a couple of pages,
and there I was.</i>

58
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:41,128
<i>I can 't go on with this. This is suicide.</i>

59
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,707
<i>But I can 't turn around now.
I'd be a laughing stock.</i>

60
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:55,711
<i>Still, I wouldn 't last six hours down there,
let alone six months.</i>

61
00:08:58,457 --> 00:09:00,448
<i>Uh ,,,</i>

62
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,626
<i>How do you,,,?</i>

63
00:09:04,897 --> 00:09:07,388
<i>Don't worry about a thing,</i>

64
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:13,063
<i>I feel my way through these mountains
blindfolded all the time,</i>

65
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,551
<i>Tell me, Tyler,,,</i>

66
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,492
what's in the Valley of the Blackstone?

67
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:38,189
What is it? Manganese?

68
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:40,824
<i>Can't be oil,</i>

69
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:45,126
Is it gold?

70
00:09:45,203 --> 00:09:48,195
<i>It's kind of hard to say,</i>

71
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:54,742
<i>You're a smart man, Tyler,
Keep your own counsel,</i>

72
00:09:54,813 --> 00:09:58,715
We're all of us prospectors
up here, eh, Tyler?

73
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:05,450
Scratching for that one crack in the ground

74
00:10:05,524 --> 00:10:08,789
<i>so we'll never have to scratch again,</i>

75
00:10:10,362 --> 00:10:13,354
<i>I'll let you in on a little secret, Tyler,</i>

76
00:10:13,432 --> 00:10:15,923
<i>The gold's not in the ground,</i>

77
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:19,936
<i>The gold's not anywhere up here,</i>

78
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:22,769
<i>The real gold is south of 60,</i>

79
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:29,076
<i>Sittin' in living rooms,
stuck facing the boob tube, bored to death,</i>

80
00:10:29,147 --> 00:10:31,672
Bored to death, Tyler!

81
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,742
<i>(clunking)</i>

82
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,112
Ah.

83
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:42,624
<i>(engine splutters)</i>

84
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,929
<i>- (screeching)
- What was that?</i>

85
00:10:49,868 --> 00:10:51,859
<i>(rapid bleeping)</i>

86
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:55,496
Oh, Lord!

87
00:10:56,808 --> 00:10:58,139
Darn!

88
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,644
<i>- What's wrong?
- Take the stick,</i>

89
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:14,753
Arrrrgh!

90
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:18,019
What's wrong?

91
00:11:22,434 --> 00:11:25,301
<i>Boredom, Tyler,</i>

92
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,838
<i>Boredom, that's what's wrong,</i>

93
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:30,898
And how do you beat boredom, Tyler?

94
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,301
Adventure.

95
00:11:35,614 --> 00:11:37,707
Adventure, Tyler.

96
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:41,545
Where are you going? Rosie!

97
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,779
<i>Rosie, what are you doing?
I can't fly this thing, What do I do?</i>

98
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:48,985
<i>Catch the updraft there, Tyler, That's it,</i>

99
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:51,393
<i>Right in the middle, Good,</i>

100
00:11:59,071 --> 00:12:01,062
<i>- Oh!
- Ah!</i>

101
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,106
Tyler, easy, easy, easy!

102
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:08,010
<i>- Back the other way! Turn it the other way!
- What?</i>

103
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,878
<i>Tyler, back, Tyler! Tyler!</i>

104
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:13,509
Easy! Tyler!

105
00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,917
<i>The other way, That's it,</i>

106
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:19,149
<i>That's it, Good, Tyler,</i>

107
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:22,022
<i>That's it, You learn fast,</i>

108
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:28,556
<i>(engine starts)</i>

109
00:12:44,983 --> 00:12:46,974
<i>(Rosie) Whoo!</i>

110
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:38,529
<i>Rosie, it's freezing,</i>

111
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:41,766
<i>Keep moving, Tyler, Gotta keep moving,</i>

112
00:13:43,008 --> 00:13:44,771
<i>(smashing)</i>

113
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:50,008
<i>- You'll be fine,
- Gotta take it easy with some of this stuff,</i>

114
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,640
<i>Oh, uh,,,</i>

115
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:55,242
Mind your toes!

116
00:13:56,054 --> 00:13:59,490
<i>Speed, Speed is of the essence, Tyler,</i>

117
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:03,526
<i>Especially when you don't know
how much fuel you got,</i>

118
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:06,155
<i>(smashing)</i>

119
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:14,636
<i>You got any last messages for the world,
Tyler, you better let me have 'em now,</i>

120
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:24,305
<i>That's sneaky, Tyler, Very sneaky,</i>

121
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:31,715
<i>Wait, Rosie! Rosie!</i>

122
00:14:36,127 --> 00:14:38,118
<i>- Rosie,
- What?</i>

123
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,332
Hey?

124
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,198
Remember my position, will you?

125
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,831
<i>Sure, I'll stop by
for a drink sometime, huh?</i>

126
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:56,780
Rosie! Rosie!

127
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:01,217
What?

128
00:15:01,286 --> 00:15:05,916
<i>- What is my position?
- It beats the hell out of me, Tyler,</i>

129
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:09,358
<i>I just hope I can find my way home,</i>

130
00:15:09,427 --> 00:15:11,691
<i>Good luck, Tyler,</i>

131
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:13,390
<i>Yeah,</i>

132
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:48,686
<i>Well, interesting.</i>

133
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:57,262
<i>Now, what are the possibilities here?</i>

134
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:01,395
<i>The possibilities...</i>

135
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:11,409
<i>are many.</i>

136
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:18,881
<i>Gotta stay rational, be objective and. . .</i>

137
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:25,322
<i>plan out all the proper procedures
before doing anything else.</i>

138
00:17:25,397 --> 00:17:31,825
<i>Make a list of priorities, remembering,
of course, to take into account variables,</i>

139
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:37,205
<i>and the fact that, inevitably,
some problems could arise that. . .</i>

140
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:45,640
<i>. . . inevitably, some problems could arise
that are completely unexpected.</i>

141
00:17:53,725 --> 00:17:56,558
<i>Get a grip on yourself.</i>

142
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:12,973
<i>Section 3C of my instructions
reads as follows:</i>

143

<i>''You will proceed immediately, by means
of canoe and utilizing local waterways,</i>

144

<i>(lively accordion music)</i>

<i>Excuse me, You sort of,,,</i>

177
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:06,259
Could you give me a hand
with some of this equipment, I wonder?

<i>I've decided to stay here

<i>For the first time in three days

192

<i>and begin trying to do my job.</i>

193
00:30:05,089 --> 00:30:07,853
<i>So far I've collected
the following specimens:</i>

194
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:11,088
<i>five baby mice, one millipede</i>

195
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:14,529
<i>and something that looks
suspiciously like fleas.</i>

196
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:18,261
<i>My instructions are to track down
a specimen of Canis lupus,</i>

197
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:23,534
<i>dispatch it with a rifle
and examine the contents of its stomach.</i>

<i>April 1 6.</i>

203
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:02,850
<i>Warm days bring
a kind of peace and stillness.</i>

204
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:04,917
<i>If there are any remaining fears,</i>

205
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:10,991
<i>they stem only from the recognition
of my own staggering insignificance.</i>

206
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,842
<i>(distant howling)</i>

207
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,651
<i>(howling continues)</i>

<i>May 3. In pursuit of phantoms.</i>

<i>I hear them every night, have seen
their tracks and collected their scat.</i>

210
00:34:55,612 --> 00:34:58,103
<i>So they must be real.</i>

211
00:35:15,566 --> 00:35:17,557

<i>The largest and rarest of the wolf species.</i>

215
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:47,721
<i>And its den.</i>

216
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:10,802
<i>The rules of the game are to choose
an observation post downwind,</i>

217

<i>out of the animal's field of vision,</i>

218

<i>gain your position and maintain it
without ever revealing your presence.</i>

219
00:37:26,997 --> 00:37:31,661
<i>Outmaneuvered on all counts,
I opt to change the rules.</i>

220

<i>(pans clanking)</i>

00:37:39,176 --> 00:37:42,270
<i>I decide to reveal

<i>(wolf grunts)</i>

225

<i>I haven't seen the wolf in two days.</i>

226
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:30,424
<i>I know I was violating the distance
principle, moving so far into his territory.</i>

227
00:38:30,494 --> 00:38:34,988
<i>But since he hadn't seemed afraid of me,
I hoped that I could. . .</i>

<i>I didn't take it personally.</i>

233
00:39:52,242 --> 00:39:56,235
<i>This was a matter of principle,
a territorial dispute.</i>

234
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:59,009
<i>And he had fired the first shot.</i>

235

# What never?
No, never

236
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:03,786

<i>including a 100-yard section
of the wolf's path.</i>

253

<i>What had taken me six hours
and 27 cups of tea,</i>

254
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:02,263
<i>he accomplished in just a few minutes.</i>

255
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:06,435
<i>At each of the places that I'd marked,
he made his mark on the opposite side,</i>

256
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,378
<i>indicating that my boundary
was acceptable to him.</i>

257
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:21,518
<i>And thus he granted me the space
for Lupus Base One.</i>

258
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:34,328
<i>I'm supposed to watch his behavior,</i>

259
00:43:34,397 --> 00:43:39,334
<i>but all he does is stay
in front of his den and watch mine.</i>

260
00:43:39,402 --> 00:43:44,999
<i>I can't remember ever being the object
of so much constant attention.</i>

261

<i>I now arise at 1 0: 00 in the evening,</i>

263
00:44:04,494 --> 00:44:07,952
<i>In my notebook,
the wolf has become George.</i>

264
00:44:29,686 --> 00:44:31,916
<i>The two are identical in color,</i>

265
00:44:31,988 --> 00:44:36,448
<i>with the same contrasting
shoulder marking and long-legged gait.</i>

266
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:41,520
<i>But I've detected a difference,
and I've named her Angeline.</i>

267
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,810
<i>As George has become a family of five,</i>

268
00:45:02,886 --> 00:45:08,188
<i>the reason for his long staring match
with me has lost its mystery.</i>

269
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:55,004
<i>It's well-known that wolves mate for life,
but knowing that has hardly prepared me</i>

270
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:59,007
<i>for their constant and varied
displays of affection.</i>

271
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:02,806
<i>Every evening George goes off
on his nightly rounds.</i>

272
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:06,940
<i>What he does on these excursions
remains a mystery to me.</i>

273
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:09,746
<i>Angeline always remains
behind with the cubs,</i>

274
00:46:09,819 --> 00:46:13,311

<i>It's perplexing.</i>

280
00:47:16,186 --> 00:47:19,883
<i>The overall reason behind the study
is that the government wants final proof</i>

281
00:47:19,956 --> 00:47:25,588
<i>that wolves are responsible
for the disastrous decline in caribou.</i>

282
00:47:25,662 --> 00:47:33,000
<i>So far I haven 't seen a single caribou,
or observed the wolves eating anything.</i>

283
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:35,697
<i>My own food supplies
are nearing exhaustion,</i>

284
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:39,435
<i>and the local environment
offers scant pickings.</i>

285
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:43,240
<i>Yet the wolves seem perfectly healthy.</i>

286
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:45,474
<i>I've done numerous scatological studies</i>

287
00:47:45,548 --> 00:47:49,245
<i>and only turned up a smattering
of small mammal bones.</i>

288
00:47:49,319 --> 00:47:51,981
<i>The whole question of sustenance
around Lupus Base One</i>

289
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:54,888

<i>(scuttling)</i>

294

<i>Angeline has given me the first clue.</i>

295
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,090
<i>In less than an hour
she's caught and consumed 23 mice.</i>

296
00:49:08,164 --> 00:49:11,656
<i>My rough calculation:
one mouse every ten square feet.</i>

297
00:49:11,734 --> 00:49:14,760
<i>Over 40,000 square feet in an acre.</i>

298
00:49:14,837 --> 00:49:17,931
<i>That's 4,000 mice per acre.</i>

299
00:49:26,816 --> 00:49:29,614
<i>The idea that a large animal
could live entirely on mice</i>

300
00:49:29,686 --> 00:49:32,382
<i>will be greeted with skepticism,</i>

301
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:35,720

<i>I expected one of the pack battles
I'd read so much about.</i>

315
00:53:51,914 --> 00:53:54,246
<i>It was Angie who was
right in the middle of things,</i>

316
00:53:54,317 --> 00:53:57,809
<i>asserting her position
as the dominant female.</i>

317
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,481
<i>The challenges and assertions
were mostly symbolic.</i>

318
00:54:00,556 --> 00:54:02,547
<i>There was no real fighting.</i>

319
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:05,389
<i>But Angeline got her point across.</i>

320
00:54:06,195 --> 00:54:08,026
<i>George was never challenged.</i>

321
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:10,793
<i>He just stood there
with his air of masterful certainty,</i>

322
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:13,495
<i>the alpha wolf of the pack.</i>

323
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:16,367
<i>Usually, only the dominant pair
mate and have offspring,</i>

324
00:54:16,439 --> 00:54:19,499
<i>going to seek their own privacy
for that purpose.</i>

325
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:23,807
<i>Apparently, the time had arrived
to rejoin the pack.</i>

326
00:54:52,175 --> 00:54:56,509
<i>There's a young brown wolf who seems
to be a particular favorite of the cubs.</i>

327
00:54:56,579 --> 00:54:59,173
<i>I've named him Uncle Albert.</i>

328
00:55:03,686 --> 00:55:08,817
<i>Now Angeline is free again
to join George on his nightly rounds.</i>

329
00:55:40,189 --> 00:55:42,180
<i>July 1 2.</i>

330
00:55:44,193 --> 00:55:49,062
<i>I wonder why it was that long ago
I became a watcher of things.</i>

<i>Always watching others do and feel things
I wouldn't or couldn't do myself.</i>

332
00:55:55,705 --> 00:56:00,972
<i>Always standing off at a distance,
isolated, detached.</i>

333
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:06,645
<i>I envy the wolves
for how they experience the world.</i>

334
00:56:06,716 --> 00:56:09,310
<i>Always in such direct contact
with their environment,</i>

335
00:56:09,385 --> 00:56:11,376
<i>traveling through their territories,</i>

336
00:56:11,454 --> 00:56:16,050
<i>alert and attuned to all the signs
coming in through their senses,</i>

337
00:56:16,125 --> 00:56:20,357
<i>telling them where a rabbit

338
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,958
<i>revealing a whole universe to them
that we can never really know.</i>

339
00:56:29,005 --> 00:56:34,705
<i>But I sit behind glass lenses,
filling up notebooks and triplicate forms,</i>

340
00:56:34,777 --> 00:56:40,079
<i>trying to capture the wolves
within the pages of my journal.</i>

341
00:56:40,149 --> 00:56:43,744
<i>And what'll be done with the study
when I'm finished?</i>

342
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,620
<i>Once these wolves
have been exposed to my world. . .</i>

343
00:56:48,357 --> 00:56:51,190
<i>what will happen to them ?</i>

344
00:57:10,546 --> 00:57:14,573
<i>There's a strange wolf
that I only see fleetingly.</i>

345
00:57:16,152 --> 00:57:20,248
<i>He must be part of the pack,
but an outsider,</i>

346
00:57:20,323 --> 00:57:22,985
<i>always following at a distance.</i>

347
00:57:24,427 --> 00:57:27,089
<i>Perhaps another watcher.</i>

348
00:58:39,602 --> 00:58:42,230
<i>(high-pitched bird call)</i>

349
00:58:42,305 --> 00:58:44,296
Oh!

350
00:59:14,737 --> 00:59:17,706
<i>Ootek thought you might need
some company,</i>

351
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:20,633
Ootek?

352
00:59:25,014 --> 00:59:27,005
<i>Hello,</i>

353
00:59:41,731 --> 00:59:44,427
<i>Really can't tell you how glad I am
to see the two of you,</i>

354
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,163
<i>It's been so long
since I heard another human voice,</i>

355
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:51,103
You have any ketchup here?

356
00:59:51,841 --> 00:59:55,777
<i>No, I don't, I'm sorry,
I ran out a couple of weeks ago,</i>

357
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:58,336
<i>Here, have some fish,</i>

358
01:00:00,683 --> 01:00:02,548
<i>Uh, no,</i>

359
01:00:02,618 --> 01:00:05,109
<i>No, thanks, I don't eat fish,</i>

360
01:00:07,923 --> 01:00:10,255
What do you eat?

361
01:00:10,726 --> 01:00:12,717
<i>Actually,,,</i>

362
01:00:13,896 --> 01:00:16,057
<i>I eat mice,</i>

363
01:00:18,234 --> 01:00:21,533
<i>- You eat mice?
- Yeah,</i>

364
01:00:26,008 --> 01:00:28,499
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

365
01:00:30,913 --> 01:00:33,711
<i>It's an experiment, really,</i>

366
01:00:33,783 --> 01:00:37,549
<i>You see, the wolves are supposed to eat
caribou, However, there are no caribou,</i>

367
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,145
<i>Basically, what the wolves
have been eating is mice,</i>

368
01:00:40,222 --> 01:00:44,921
So I'm conducting an experiment
to see whether a carnivore, a big animal,

369
01:00:44,994 --> 01:00:47,053
<i>can live on nothing but mice,</i>

370
01:00:47,129 --> 01:00:51,566
<i>So I've been just eating mice,
and I'm doing fine,</i>

371
01:00:55,337 --> 01:00:57,328
<i>(translates)</i>

372
01:01:15,558 --> 01:01:19,722
<i>- What does he say?
- He says, "Good idea,"</i>

373
01:01:23,933 --> 01:01:26,595
<i>(two men speak native language)</i>

374
01:01:30,439 --> 01:01:32,634
<i>(Tyler) Syringe,</i>

375
01:01:32,708 --> 01:01:34,699
<i>There,</i>

376
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:46,844
<i>- What's that?
- Clamp, This thing? Yeah,</i>

377
01:01:46,922 --> 01:01:48,981
See the way this is set up here?

378
01:01:49,058 --> 01:01:52,653
<i>This is so it grabs ahold, You got him,</i>

379
01:01:52,728 --> 01:01:54,719
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

380
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:58,128
<i>It's a gripper,</i>

381

<i>(speaks native language)</i>

382
01:02:00,503 --> 01:02:03,097
<i>I know what that is,
They had them at the mines,</i>

383
01:02:03,172 --> 01:02:07,700
<i>Yeah, that's right, It's a gas mask,
except that I use it for wolf scats,</i>

384
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:13,181
<i>The wolf scat has little tiny animals,
little tiny parasites,</i>

385
01:02:13,249 --> 01:02:16,776
And if you breathe these things in,
you breathe these little guys,

386
01:02:16,852 --> 01:02:21,448
<i>they go up into your brain
and they eat it out,</i>

387
01:02:21,524 --> 01:02:23,890
Scat? What is scat?

388
01:02:24,326 --> 01:02:25,918
<i>Uh,,,</i>

389
01:02:25,995 --> 01:02:28,054
<i>Wolf droppings,</i>

390
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:32,328
See, the idea behind this is
if you study what comes out of a wolf,

391
01:02:32,401 --> 01:02:35,768
<i>you get a pretty good idea what went in,</i>

392
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:37,669
<i>Hmm,</i>

393
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,801
<i>I got a whole bag of them down there,
I got a whole sack,</i>

394
01:02:41,877 --> 01:02:43,868
<i>(translates)</i>

395
01:02:51,787 --> 01:02:54,119
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

396
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,951
What did he say?

397
01:03:00,029 --> 01:03:02,759
<i>He says, "Good idea,"</i>

398
01:03:22,985 --> 01:03:24,976
<i>(howling)</i>

399
01:03:33,529 --> 01:03:35,520
<i>(howling continues)</i>

400
01:03:42,705 --> 01:03:45,037
<i>(speak native language)</i>

401
01:03:56,785 --> 01:04:00,653
<i>And so they settled in with me,
as if nothing could be more natural.</i>

402
01:04:05,027 --> 01:04:08,463
<i>For my part,
I'm glad to have the company.</i>

403
01:04:08,530 --> 01:04:10,521
<i>A seven,</i>

404
01:04:14,436 --> 01:04:16,427
<i>Mike had gone to school in the south.</i>

405
01:04:16,505 --> 01:04:18,905
<i>When his parents died,
Ootek adopted him.</i>

406
01:04:18,974 --> 01:04:22,933
<i>Traditionally, they are no orphans
among the Inuit.</i>

407
01:04:23,012 --> 01:04:25,503
<i>(plays stilted tune)</i>

408
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:39,856
I met a girl in a bar,

409
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:43,057
<i>and she wanted me to buy her drinks,
so I bought her some,</i>

410
01:04:43,132 --> 01:04:47,466
<i>And then after a while,
she wanted to come home with me,</i>

411
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:51,632
<i>But I made a mistake,</i>

412
01:04:51,707 --> 01:04:54,369
<i>I smiled at her,</i>

413
01:04:55,144 --> 01:04:59,740
<i>That's what happens when a meat eater
becomes a sugar eater,</i>

414
01:05:14,263 --> 01:05:17,460
<i>Ootek has taken
a particular interest in the study,</i>

415
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:23,961
<i>though I've learned there is little about
wolves that he doesn 't already know.</i>

416
01:05:30,479 --> 01:05:33,243
<i>But I sense there is another side to Ootek,</i>

417
01:05:33,315 --> 01:05:36,250
<i>some part of his nature
that he hasn 't shown.</i>

418
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:38,479
<i>I try not to annoy him
with too many questions,</i>

419
01:05:38,554 --> 01:05:41,921
<i>but there are many things I'd like to know.</i>

420
01:06:08,117 --> 01:06:10,449
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

421
01:06:15,924 --> 01:06:19,690
<i>When he was young
he used to follow the wolves on their hunts,</i>

422
01:06:21,096 --> 01:06:23,428
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

423
01:06:26,368 --> 01:06:30,065
<i>The wolf is his helping spirit: amarok.</i>

424
01:06:32,908 --> 01:06:35,741
<i>- Ama...
- Amarok.</i>

425
01:06:35,811 --> 01:06:37,802
<i>- Ama...
- The wolf,</i>

426
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,371
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

427
01:06:51,193 --> 01:06:56,495
<i>He went 30 days without food
and without protection from the cold,</i>

428
01:07:03,705 --> 01:07:06,196
<i>Then he saw the wolf,</i>

429
01:07:13,749 --> 01:07:17,742
<i>He felt the wolf bite into his heart,</i>

430
01:07:24,326 --> 01:07:29,127
<i>When he woke up, he was all in one piece,</i>

431
01:07:31,033 --> 01:07:35,436
<i>That's how the wolf
became his helping spirit,</i>

432
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:49,841
<i>(howling)</i>

433
01:08:39,635 --> 01:08:42,866
<i>I wonder what makes them howl like that,</i>

434
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:48,332
<i>They howl when they're lonely,</i>

435
01:08:50,812 --> 01:08:53,303
<i>Or to call their friends,</i>

436
01:08:55,384 --> 01:08:59,878
<i>That way, the other,,,
the others will know where they are,</i>

437
01:08:59,955 --> 01:09:03,891
<i>and then sooner or later
they're bound to meet up,</i>

438
01:09:07,095 --> 01:09:11,259
<i>That's the way to catch wolves,
Go where they're howling,</i>

439
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:14,302
Hide behind a rock,

440
01:09:14,369 --> 01:09:16,735
<i>and then howl like one of them,</i>

441
01:09:16,805 --> 01:09:21,242
<i>And then,,, they will come to investigate,</i>

442
01:09:23,912 --> 01:09:26,244
Yeah?

443
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,183
<i>When they get close enough,
you shoot 'em,</i>

444
01:09:34,423 --> 01:09:37,517
<i>You shoot 'em,
Hopefully you hit 'em,</i>

445
01:09:43,732 --> 01:09:46,394
<i>That's how you kill a wolf,</i>

446
01:09:53,442 --> 01:09:56,673
<i>To me, wolves mean money,</i>

447
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:01,408
<i>It's a way of making a living,</i>

448
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:09,352
<i>One wolf pelt costs about $350,</i>

449
01:10:14,429 --> 01:10:16,863
And I'vegottofeed myfamily.

450
01:10:16,932 --> 01:10:18,923
<i>My children,</i>

451
01:10:20,235 --> 01:10:23,204
Buy a snowmobile,

452
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:26,867
<i>food, rifle, bullets, whatever,</i>

453
01:10:32,481 --> 01:10:34,972
<i>You wouldn't,,,</i>

454
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:37,712
I mean, you wouldn't kill these wolves?

455
01:10:37,786 --> 01:10:40,118
<i>These ones? Oh,</i>

456
01:10:41,423 --> 01:10:43,823
<i>No, I don't think so,</i>

457
01:10:43,892 --> 01:10:48,488
<i>Besides, you would get mad
if I killed one of them,</i>

458
01:10:48,563 --> 01:10:51,555
<i>And your gun is bigger than mine,</i>

459
01:10:56,838 --> 01:10:59,136
<i>Yeah,</i>

460
01:11:00,409 --> 01:11:02,900
<i>I'd like to, though,</i>

461
01:11:24,099 --> 01:11:26,693
<i>Last week in August.</i>

462
01:11:26,768 --> 01:11:30,568
<i>The Arctic summer has almost ended.</i>

463
01:11:30,639 --> 01:11:36,874
<i>As the time grows short, I'm reluctant to
even sleep, for fear of missing something.</i>

464
01:11:36,945 --> 01:11:40,904
<i>It's hard to imagine
that soon I'll have to leave.</i>

465
01:11:40,982 --> 01:11:44,645
<i>But this place doesn 't belong to man.
It belongs to the wolves.</i>

466
01:11:47,089 --> 01:11:51,321
<i>I can't really be sad, because it's here
that I've begun to feel wonder again,</i>

467
01:11:51,393 --> 01:11:55,853
<i>like when I was a kid,
and this makes me deeply happy.</i>

468
01:11:56,865 --> 01:12:02,963
<i>I wish I could say thank so,
just so, straight into the universe.</i>

469
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:31,824
<i>The rest of Ootek's family,
traveling through on their way north,</i>

470
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:34,391
<i>stopped by to spend the night.</i>

471
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:50,140
<i>(Ootek speaks native language)</i>

472
01:12:54,823 --> 01:12:58,987
He wants me to tell you a story
of when there was nothing in the world

473
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:02,518
<i>except for a man and a woman,</i>

474
01:13:02,597 --> 01:13:05,259
The woman came to a hole in the ice,

475
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:11,272
<i>and she reached in and felt something,
so she pulled it out,</i>

476
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:15,042
<i>And itwasatuktu,which isthecaribou.</i>

477
01:13:16,011 --> 01:13:21,472
<i>And it was this animal that the lnuit
needed for their food and clothing,</i>

478
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:28,854
<i>For many years there were so many
caribou that the people called them lice,</i>

479
01:13:28,924 --> 01:13:33,623
But soon all the hunting killed off
all the fat, healthy animals,

480
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:38,723
<i>and the only ones left over
were the weak, sick ones,</i>

481
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,759
Soon they began to breed and multiply,

482
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:47,031
<i>and the herd got weak,</i>

483
01:13:49,377 --> 01:13:51,174
<i>Sick,</i>

484
01:13:56,017 --> 01:13:58,485
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

485
01:14:02,924 --> 01:14:08,487
<i>So the people came back to the woman
to ask her what to do,</i>

486
01:14:08,563 --> 01:14:11,464
She went back to the hole in the ice,

487
01:14:11,533 --> 01:14:16,300
because she needed a tool
to cut the sickness out of the herd,

488
01:14:16,371 --> 01:14:19,135
<i>and the amarok was born,</i>

489
01:14:21,343 --> 01:14:23,334
<i>Amarok.</i>

490
01:14:25,113 --> 01:14:30,608
The wolves hunted the caribou
and they killed off all the weak, sick ones,

491
01:14:31,353 --> 01:14:35,551
<i>and the people had
all the caribou that they needed,</i>

492
01:14:35,624 --> 01:14:37,956
<i>(speak native language)</i>

493
01:14:51,139 --> 01:14:55,235
<i>She says maybe you're like Ootek,</i>

494
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:58,802
<i>Maybe a long time ago
the wolf devoured you,</i>

495
01:15:03,985 --> 01:15:06,317
<i>(distant howl)</i>

496
01:15:09,357 --> 01:15:11,348

<i>(speaks native language)</i>

499
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,183
He knows, doesn't he?

500
01:15:38,186 --> 01:15:41,087
<i>He knows what they're saying,</i>

501
01:15:41,156 --> 01:15:46,093
The caribou are coming south
and the hunting will be good,

502
01:15:46,161 --> 01:15:48,959
<i>and the amarok will be there,</i>

503
01:16:33,475 --> 01:16:36,103
<i>We broke camp
and went in separate directions.</i>

504
01:16:36,177 --> 01:16:39,840
<i>Mike went south, while Ootek
led me on a three-day trek,</i>

505
01:16:39,914 --> 01:16:43,247
<i>down out of the high country
and on to the tundra.</i>

506
01:16:43,318 --> 01:16:46,549
<i>There will be wolves there,
he said, as well as the ''tuktu'',</i>

507
01:16:46,621 --> 01:16:51,456
<i>the great caribou herds
that once had sustained his people.</i>

508
01:17:38,473 --> 01:17:41,033
<i>His endurance
is very much greater than mine,</i>

509
01:17:41,109 --> 01:17:43,600
<i>but there are no expectations of me.</i>

510
01:17:43,678 --> 01:17:47,409
<i>Not, I think, because I am the ''kabloona, ''
the white man,</i>

511
01:17:47,482 --> 01:17:51,612
<i>but because he doesn 't recognize
such a thing as impatience.</i>

512
01:17:51,686 --> 01:17:54,154
<i>(thunder)</i>

513
01:17:54,222 --> 01:17:56,213
<i>(chanting)</i>

514
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,148
Whoo!

515
01:20:24,772 --> 01:20:26,763
<i>(caribou grunting)</i>

516
01:25:56,704 --> 01:26:01,300
<i>Deep in the bone,
the marrow reveals the disease.</i>

517
01:26:01,375 --> 01:26:05,744
<i>And she had found the tool
to cut the sickness from the herd.</i>

518
01:26:17,491 --> 01:26:19,482
<i>(chanting)</i>

519
01:27:03,537 --> 01:27:05,528
<i>(distant gunshots)</i>

520
01:27:20,988 --> 01:27:24,446
<i>Gunfire and the smell of gasoline.</i>

521
01:27:24,525 --> 01:27:26,516
<i>(laughter)</i>

522
01:27:30,531 --> 01:27:32,522
<i>(music on radio)</i>

523
01:27:46,013 --> 01:27:48,345
Come on, right over here!

524
01:27:59,293 --> 01:28:01,022
<i>Hello, Rosie,</i>

525
01:28:03,097 --> 01:28:05,292
Is that you, Tyler?

526
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:10,035
<i>They called off the search,
They wrote you off,</i>

527
01:28:10,104 --> 01:28:13,505
<i>I even said a few Hail Marys for you myself,</i>

528
01:28:13,574 --> 01:28:17,169
<i>But I never believed in ghosts,
How are you?</i>

529
01:28:17,244 --> 01:28:22,409
<i>- You all right? You got all your pieces?
- I'm all right, yeah,</i>

530
01:28:22,483 --> 01:28:25,475
<i>- You've changed,
- I've changed?</i>

531
01:28:28,923 --> 01:28:33,155
What the hell you been
doing out here, anyway?

532
01:28:33,227 --> 01:28:37,926
<i>Tyler, you wouldn't believe what's
happened, It's fantastic, I hit the jackpot,</i>

533
01:28:37,998 --> 01:28:40,125
<i>Two new planes, a new hotel,</i>

534
01:28:40,201 --> 01:28:42,601
Have you seen an old lnuk?

535
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:46,800
Inuk? Eskimo? Drunk or sober?

536
01:28:46,874 --> 01:28:48,705
<i>Quite sober,</i>

537
01:28:51,512 --> 01:28:53,844
<i>Join the party,</i>

538
01:29:01,822 --> 01:29:05,087
Altogether, 1400acres.

539
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:09,619
<i>Top of the mountain down to the lake,
including mineral rights,</i>

540
01:29:09,697 --> 01:29:14,964
<i>But the real ace in the hole for us right now
is the hot spring right up there,</i>

541
01:29:15,035 --> 01:29:18,596
<i>Amazing, lncredible, Steaming hot water
coming right out of the ground,</i>

542
01:29:18,672 --> 01:29:21,971
When I say hot water,
what are you thinking?

543
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:24,374
Sitting in the bath tub?

544
01:29:25,579 --> 01:29:30,573
<i>Japanese, A little bit of advertising,
plenty of raw fish,</i>

545
01:29:32,553 --> 01:29:35,613
<i>Beautiful country all right,</i>

546
01:29:35,689 --> 01:29:38,180
<i>Limitless possibilities,</i>

547
01:29:39,226 --> 01:29:42,787
<i>Japanese, That's a great angle, Rosie,</i>

548
01:29:44,465 --> 01:29:47,434
<i>Wait, You haven't heard the best part,
Listen to this,</i>

549
01:29:47,501 --> 01:29:52,837
Once they've soaked their little buns
in our magic, medicinal hot spring,

550
01:29:52,907 --> 01:29:56,240
<i>you bottle it up, stick a fancy label on it,
they take it home with them,</i>

551
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:59,006
<i>Before you know it, we'll be
shipping it outta here by the truckload,</i>

552
01:29:59,079 --> 01:30:04,244
<i>And what does it cost us? Nothing,
Just bubbles right out of the ground,</i>

553
01:30:04,318 --> 01:30:07,048
<i>I bet you we could figure out a way
to bottle the air up here, too,</i>

554
01:30:07,121 --> 01:30:09,555
<i>Fantastic,</i>

555
01:30:09,623 --> 01:30:12,615
<i>Gentlemen, here's to the future,</i>

556
01:30:31,312 --> 01:30:33,303
<i>Watch the horns,</i>

557
01:30:46,293 --> 01:30:49,353
<i>Come on, Tyler, Climb in,</i>

558
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:52,160
<i>I'm taking you out,</i>

559
01:30:53,667 --> 01:31:00,505
<i>Look, Tyler, maybe you can't see it,
but you've gone round the bend a little,</i>

560
01:31:02,076 --> 01:31:04,476
<i>I know, I've seen it before,</i>

561
01:31:04,545 --> 01:31:06,877
<i>Come on, Get in the,,,</i>

562
01:31:07,715 --> 01:31:10,377
<i>(chuckles)</i>

563
01:31:11,852 --> 01:31:14,616
<i>I know where your camp is, Tyler,</i>

564
01:31:15,923 --> 01:31:20,553
<i>I'll meet you there in a couple of days,
We'll talk it over,</i>

565
01:31:48,455 --> 01:31:52,414
<i>How could he have known about
Lupus Base unless he'd been there?</i>

566
01:31:52,493 --> 01:31:54,791
<i>To get back would be
a three-day hike for me,</i>

567
01:31:54,862 --> 01:31:58,025
<i>but for him, it's only minutes away.</i>

568
01:32:59,994 --> 01:33:01,985
<i>(whining)</i>

569
01:33:06,734 --> 01:33:08,725
<i>(whining)</i>

570
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:25,541
Pups, where's your folks?

571
01:33:30,090 --> 01:33:32,820
<i>It's pretty lonely around here,</i>

572
01:33:35,729 --> 01:33:41,133
<i>Don't you worry about anything,
Everything's gonna be just fine,</i>

573
01:33:41,201 --> 01:33:43,795
<i>(plane overhead)</i>

574
01:35:24,171 --> 01:35:26,162
Get outta there!

575
01:35:27,541 --> 01:35:32,569
Get out of here, Rosie!
I don't want you here! Get out of here!

576
01:35:33,547 --> 01:35:35,708
Get away!

577
01:35:53,133 --> 01:35:55,465
<i>(gunshot)</i>

578
01:36:53,927 --> 01:36:56,259
<i>(music on radio)</i>

579
01:37:10,878 --> 01:37:12,675
<i>Mike,</i>

580
01:37:13,614 --> 01:37:16,811
What are you doing here?

581
01:37:16,884 --> 01:37:20,479
<i>I'm on my way north,
The snow is coming,</i>

582
01:37:22,756 --> 01:37:25,247
Have you seen Ootek?

583
01:37:25,325 --> 01:37:26,883
<i>No,</i>

584
01:37:27,995 --> 01:37:30,793
<i>He just disappeared,
We were out there and he,,,</i>

585
01:37:30,864 --> 01:37:37,497
<i>Yeah, I know, The old ones seem to have
a way of doing that, just disappearing,</i>

586
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:41,207
<i>Which is what I'm about to do,</i>

587
01:37:54,888 --> 01:37:59,825
Have you seen the wolves?
Have you seen George and Angie?

588
01:37:59,893 --> 01:38:02,487
<i>No, they must have gone north,</i>

589
01:38:02,562 --> 01:38:06,658
<i>No, No, the puppies are still here, They
wouldn't go off and leave the puppies,</i>

590
01:38:06,733 --> 01:38:11,466
<i>Stop worrying about the pups
and start worrying about yourself,</i>

591
01:38:11,538 --> 01:38:15,304
<i>This thing that's happening
is too big for you,</i>

592
01:38:18,345 --> 01:38:21,906
<i>It's a question of how you survive it,</i>

593
01:38:25,519 --> 01:38:27,646
<i>Survival,,,</i>

594
01:38:29,256 --> 01:38:31,781
<i>of the fittest,</i>

595
01:39:26,413 --> 01:39:28,404
<i>(# bassoon playing)</i>

596
01:39:39,726 --> 01:39:42,752
<i>In the end, there were no simple answers.</i>

597
01:39:42,829 --> 01:39:44,820
<i>No heroes, no villains.</i>

598
01:39:46,433 --> 01:39:48,298
<i>Only silence.</i>

599
01:40:00,414 --> 01:40:05,477
<i>But it began the moment
that I first saw the wolf.</i>

600
01:40:05,552 --> 01:40:10,615
<i>By the act of watching them,
with the eyes of a man,</i>

601
01:40:10,690 --> 01:40:14,319
<i>I had pointed the way
for those who followed.</i>

602
01:40:17,764 --> 01:40:19,755
<i>(howling)</i>

603
01:41:06,546 --> 01:41:11,540
<i>The pack returned for the cubs, as
there are no orphans among the wolves.</i>

604
01:41:11,618 --> 01:41:16,055
<i>And eventually the losses of that autumn
became a distant memory.</i>

605
01:41:29,903 --> 01:41:34,533
<i>I believe the wolves went off to a wild
and distant place somewhere,</i>

606
01:41:34,608 --> 01:41:37,304
<i>although I don 't really know,</i>

607
01:41:37,377 --> 01:41:41,871
<i>because I turned away
and didn 't watch them go.</i>
